# ng14-ng17-upgrade

##
This is a demo to show that will showcase an Angular application starting from version 14 and then upgrading to version 17, using Module Federation. This application specifically will be a shell/host for other MFE remote applications to consume.  

###
I will start all the way from building a base Angular Module Federation shell app with version 14, to a working Angular 17 shell.
